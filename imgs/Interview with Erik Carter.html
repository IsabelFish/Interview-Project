                <p class="answer">
                    I’m an independent graphic designer based in New 
York City. In the past I’ve worked for Google, MTV, The New York Times 
and the Office of Paul Sahre. My work typically falls into the 
illustration, book cover, animation, AR, and merchandise categories but I
 try not to feel limited by those labels.

                    I think I was subconsciously inspired by the cover 
of the Pixies Wave of Mutilation: Best of Pixies designed by Vaughan 
Oliver. <span class="img-star">✷⁠</span> I had a poster of this art on 
my bedroom wall in high school and I remember reading an interview where
 he wanted to pay homage to Andy Warhol’s cover of The Velvet 
Underground and Nico <span class="img-star">✷⁠</span> by doing a modern technicolor banana as opposed to the classic “peel slowly and see.” So really it’s just a ripoff of a ripoff!

                <p class="answer">
                    The dot pattern in the lower left is actually a typeface (Elmira by Muk Monsalve <span class="img-star">✷⁠</span>,
 to be exact) rotated and stretched to the point of abstraction. I 
always like it when I can take a typeface to a place where it becomes 
something other than its intended use.

                    What was it like working with so many fonts? What advice would you give another designer?

                <p class="answer">
                    I don’t mind working with a high number of fonts. 
Sometimes using only one or two typefaces can be limiting, so the more 
fonts the better! Using multiple fonts can be difficult but I think when
 they come together with color or a filter/texture they can often be 
harmonious.
