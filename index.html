                    <span class="first-letter">W</span>hat initial steps did you take to establish yourself as a graphic designer?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <span class="first-letter-a">I</span> was very fortunate to know what I wanted to do at a very young age through tinkering on my parent‚Äôs teal iMac G3 and surfing the early days of the World Wide Web. But in terms of my ‚Äúcareer‚Äù and any sort of societal ‚Äúprofessional success‚Äù it all happened through a chaotic mix of moving to New York City, trudging through art school and many failed internships, and ultimately landing a job at the Office of Paul Sahre <span class="img-star"><a class="img-star" target="_blank" href="http://paulsahre.com/">‚ú∑</a>‚Å†</span>. The job was just us two; he took me under my wing and established me as a designer in skill and network. I‚Äôm still doing what I was doing at that job today, just in my way.

                    <span class="first-letter">Y</span>ou create a wide variety of work, from typographic book covers to 3D animation. How did you learn to work in so many different ways?

                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <span class="first-letter-a">I</span>‚Äôm a generalist and get bored easily, any time that I find myself doing the same thing over and over I try to switch things up. Any chance there is to learn a new skill I take it, and I‚Äôm very fortunate to have clients that are receptive to this unpredictable way of working.

                    "<span class="first-letter-a">W</span>e live in a society‚Äù and its pressures are not lost on me. Like any other graphic designer working under capitalism, I do work that is not on the internet and in the public‚Äôs minds to make ends meet. The challenge is to be able to balance the personal and the professional. I once saw Zach Lieberman <span class="img-star"><a class="img-star" target="_blank" href="http://zach.li/">‚ú∑</a>‚Å†</span>‚Å† break it down into ‚Öì  money work, ‚Öì personal, and ‚Öì  teaching, and on my good days, I try and hit that.
